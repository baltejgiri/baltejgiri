## Certifications
IT certifications are great way to prove the skills that an indvidual has in the field. However, getting an IT certification itself does not help. An IT certification can help to get a job interview or fullfil a requirement on on a job description but what matters on the actual job is experience and deep understanding of protocols.</br>

IT certs can be used to learn the skills, they have a good curiculum to follow but while pursuing a certification, many focus on just getting a certfication by all means and often it becomes a chasing game.</br>

Instead soley focusing on getting a certification, in my optinion it is better to use the certification curiculum and master the each concepts. Understand the fundamentals of protocols and technologies. It is important to take time and have a understanding of skills tested in the cert which will pay-off twice, first to excel at job and second to obtain a offical cert.</br>

I am going to work towards Cisco's Professional Certification for Enterprise Networking. It's is often referred as CCNP then specilises in Enterprise Networking.
