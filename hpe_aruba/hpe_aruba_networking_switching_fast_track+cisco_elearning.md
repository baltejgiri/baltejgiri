## AOS-CX: portfolio

__AOS-CX__ series switches are used from Access to Core and Data centers, they are all on same operating system and features are the same. It makes easier to maintain, and configurations are consistent. The only differences are in the hardware capacity, the bigger the hardware the more tables they support.

All switches can Open REST API and run a script and operate like SNMP and gather information by itself and monitor directly on your switch. They can interact with 3rd party devices and send it to SNMP and MAP.

### Accessing AOS-CX CLI: console port

- Console port
    - OOBM interface
    - PC-Device serial link
    - MAX 1-meter cable
    - RJ-45 and USB-C

- Serial Connection
    - Baud rate: 115200
    - Data bits: 8
    - Parity: None
    - Stop bits: 1
    - No Flow control

### AOS-CX CLI: port numbering

AOS-CX port numbering is based on a combination of slot and port identifiers, often in the format ```<slot>/<port>``` or ```<slot>/<sub-slot>/<port>```. The exact format depends on whether you're working with a modular chassis or a fixed-port switch.

The fixed port switch demonstrates the ```member ID = 1``` and ```slot = 1``` and ```port = 48```.

The modular switch shows two member ID's then each member can have it's own slot and port. Those port numbers could look like ```1/2/24``` or ```2/4/24```. Then first port reference to ```member ID = 1```, ```slot = 2``` and ```port = 24``` whereas the second port shows ```member ID = 2```, ```slot = 4``` and ```port = 24```.

### AOS-CX CLI: Prompt modes

### The value of show commands

Good network engineers and administrators must be adept at discovering the ACTUAL connectivity of the network. This can help to verify the accuracy of existing documentation, or to create new network documentations from scratch.

- Discover and document
    - Validate existing documentation
    - Create new documentation

- Baseline and troubleshoot
    - Understand what "normal' is for your network
    - Combination of good documentation and good baseline info greatly eases troubleshooting during an outage.

These show commands are valuable for baseline and troubleshooting. We can view switches performance and health parameters, including CPU and memory utilization. Monitoring switches using automation can provide a proactive approach as if a switch starts to reach the CPU and memory usage threshold network team can be alert with an incident.

| show version                  | Displays version information about network operating system software, service operating system software and BIOS.                                                             |
| show system                   | Displays general system status information about system as well as high-level CPU and memory utilization.                                                                     |
| show running-config           | Displays current nondefault configuration running on the switch.                                                                                                              |
| top CPU                       | Shows detailed CPU utilization information, the underline processes with PID (Process Identifier) and much more.                                                              |
| show events                   | Event logs generated by the switch modules since the last reboot. Log Analysis is a powerful tool to investigate and troubleshoot system and protocol related problems.       |
| show interface brief          | Available interfaces and their status. This commands is used to see interfaces status for administratively and operationally.                                                 |
| show lldp neighbor-info       | Enables you to discover and document network devices interconnected.                                                                                                          |
